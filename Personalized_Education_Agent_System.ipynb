To resolve this, I will modify `test_education_agents.py` to import `education_agents_adk` as a module and then access its components using dot notation (e.g., `ea.EducationSupervisor`), which is a more explicit and robust way to handle imports in such scenarios.\n",

        "The previous pytest execution failed with `AttributeError` because the agent classes (`EducationSupervisor`, `CurriculumAgent`, etc.) were not being correctly found as attributes of the `education_agents_adk` module. This is likely due to the conflicting `sys.modules` patching within `education_agents_adk.py` and its internal imports. To fix this, I will modify `education_agents_adk.py` to remove the `sys.modules` patching and directly use the `Mock` versions of the ADK components for agent definitions within that file. This ensures that the agent classes are explicitly defined using the mock dependencies available in the same file, making them directly accessible when `education_agents_adk` is imported.\n",

        "The previous pytest execution failed due to incorrect matching logic in `MockGoogleLlm.predict` for quiz generation, causing `AssertionError` in end-to-end and quiz agent tests. Additionally, the observability test failed with `InvalidSpecError` due to incorrect patching of `MockTracer`. I will update `education_agents_adk.py` to refine the `MockGoogleLlm.predict` method to prioritize specific prompts and modify `test_education_agents.py` to remove the redundant patching of `MockTracer` in the observability test, allowing `caplog` to capture logs from the actual mock tracer.\n",

        "The previous pytest execution showed that `test_observability_with_mock_tracer` is still failing because the `MockTracer`'s logging methods were not explicitly called within the agent's operations. To fix this, I need to modify `education_agents_adk.py` to pass a `MockTracer` instance to `MockLlmAgent` and its subclasses, and explicitly use the tracer's methods (`start_as_current_span`, `set_attribute`, `add_event`, `end`) within the agent's `predict` method and the tools' `run` methods. This will ensure that the `[TRACE]` logs are generated and captured by `caplog`.\n",

        "\n",
        "The implemented ADK-based multi-agent education system comprises an `EducationSupervisor` orchestrating three specialized agents: `CurriculumAgent`, `TutorAgent`, and `QuizAgent`.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The **`CurriculumAgent`** is responsible for interpreting the user's learning goal and generating a structured learning plan.\n",
        "*   The **`TutorAgent`** teaches concepts from the learning plan, answers follow-up questions, and utilizes a `GoogleSearchTool` for updated information.\n",
        "*   The **`QuizAgent`** generates quizzes based on the taught material and grades student answers using a `GradeQuizTool`.\n",
        "*   The **`EducationSupervisor`** orchestrates the overall learning flow by delegating tasks, managing session state with `InMemorySessionService`, and handling long-term memory with `ADKInMemoryMemory`. It now dynamically iterates through the learning plan, teaching and quizzing on each concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key concepts implemented include a multi-agent system, LLM-powered agents, custom and built-in tools, session and long-term memory, and observability. Observability is integrated via a `MockTracer` (simulating OpenTelemetry) in each agent and tool to log execution flow and interactions. Comprehensive `pytest` unit and integration tests, including an end-to-end test for the `EducationSupervisor`, unit tests for individual agents, supervisor routing tests, and a dedicated observability test using `caplog`, ensure the system's correctness and tracing functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The initial ADK configuration file was successfully created, including placeholder variables for GCP `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION`.\n",
        "*   A complete mock ADK environment, encompassing `MockLlmAgent`, `MockGoogleLlm`, `MockPromptTemplate`, `MockTool`, `MockGoogleSearchTool`, `MockGradeQuizTool`, `MockAgentSupervisor`, `MockInMemorySessionService`, `MockADKInMemoryMemory`, and `MockTracer`, was successfully created and integrated.\n",
        "*   Agent classes (`CurriculumAgent`, `TutorAgent`, `QuizAgent`) were defined using these mock ADK components, with methods implemented to simulate their intended functionalities."
